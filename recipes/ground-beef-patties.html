        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Personally, the best part of a Burger is the meaty and juicy Beef Patty. It's a primal desire satisfied.
            There are stories of how our ancestors would celebrate after a succesful hunt because of the treasured reward of meat.
            I enjoy making simple foods with minimal seasoning only to enhance the natural flavour. 
            Meat follows this description to a T. It already has an incredibly heavy and hearty taste.
            There are different Fat to Beef ratios you can find on the market, I find 15% fat to be adequate. It gives enough juice, but not so much that it's dripping and looks gross.
            It also has the benefit to make you full on very little. Meat is very dense. So give this a try! You might be surprised with the simple taste.</p>
