        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The idea for this recipe came from my love of crispy foods (like my guilty pleasure, potato chips) and my desire to have a clean diet.
            There are autoimmune diseases out there that can be triggered eating certain foods, like white potatoes.
            Therefore, the next best thing to get the same crunch is to use plantains! And they come pretty close to the real thing.
            This recipe is cheap, quick, and easy to make. It only requires a few ingredients and is good to satiate any cravings for comfort food you might have.</p>
