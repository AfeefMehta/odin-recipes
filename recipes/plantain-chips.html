        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The idea for this recipe came from my love of <strong>crispy</strong> foods (like my guilty pleasure, <strong>Potato Chips</strong>) and my desire to have a clean diet.
            There are autoimmune diseases out there that can be triggered eating certain foods, like White Potatoes.
            Therefore, the next best thing to get the same <strong>crunch</strong> is to use <strong>Plantains!</strong> And they come pretty close to the real thing.
            If you prefer, you can also cut them thicker to get chunks to bite into instead. Although, depending on the thickness, you might consider using the Oven.
            This recipe is cheap, quick, and easy to make. It only requires a few ingredients and is good to satiate any cravings for comfort food you might have.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plantains (Of course)</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the skin and cut the Plantains with around 3-5 mm thickness.</li>
            <li>Pour some Oil into a Wok or a deep frying pan.</li>
            <li>Turn the Stove up to Medium. Wait. A Plantain piece should sizzle inside.</li>
            <li>Put a reasonable amount in the Wok (You don't want them to get clumped up).</li>
            <li>As they turn golden brown, place them in a bowl. Repeat until all are cooked.</li>
            <li>Dry off the Oil if you prefer and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
