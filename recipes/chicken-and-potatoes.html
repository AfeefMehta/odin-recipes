        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a classic dish my Mom used to make when I was younger.
            I had a huge craving for spice, I absolutely loved eating French Fries, and Chicken was always my go-to choice of meat. 
            So, she had an idea to combine all 3 items into a simple, but very effectively tasty, dish that satisfies your hunger and then some.
            It's similar to a miniature version of a Thanksgiving Dinner.
            It quickly captures the heart of the meal with enough chicken to satisfy and enough of your favorite side to add variety.
            I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. It's very simple, cheap, and easy to make.</p>
