        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a classic dish my Mom used to make when I was younger.
            I had a huge craving for <strong>spice</strong>, I absolutely loved eating <strong>French Fries</strong>, and <strong>Chicken</strong> was always my go-to choice of meat. 
            So, she had an idea to combine all 3 items into a simple, but very effectively tasty, dish that satisfies your hunger and then some.
            It's similar to a miniature version of a <strong>Thanksgiving Dinner</strong>.
            It quickly captures the heart of the meal with enough chicken to satisfy and enough of your favorite side to add variety.
            I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. It's very <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>cheap</strong>, and <strong>easy to make</strong>.</p>
